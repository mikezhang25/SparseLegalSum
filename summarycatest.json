      "text": "The State Board of Equalization has determined that only parts of American Legion halls are exempt from property taxation and that other parts, such as billiard rooms, card rooms, and similar areas, are not exempt. Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and related federal regulations provide for the exemption for posts or organizations of war veterans, or an auxiliary unit or society of, or a trust or foundation for, any such post or organization that carries on programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces. Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code stipulates that all buildings, and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans' organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States. Section  215.1 further states that programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes require the use of facilities for funerals and receptions for more than 50 attendees. In a 1979 appellate court decision, the Chief Counsel of the State Equalization concluded that only the office areas used to counsel veterans and the area used to store veterans' records were exempt from taxation. The legal division further concluded that the meeting hall and bar found in most of the facilities are not considered used for charity purposes. The Equalization's opinion reflects a lack of understanding of the purpose and programs of the veterans service organizations posts or halls and the good works performed in support of our veteran community.The Legislature has determined that the use of real property by a veterans' organization as described in subdivision (a) for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is central to that organization's exempt purposes and activities. The exemption provided for in this section shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served. An organization that files a claim for the exemption shall file with the assessor a valid organizational clearance certificate issued pursuant to Section 254.6. The state shall not reimburse any local agency for any property tax revenues lost by it pursuant to this act.",

      "text": "A new report from the California Legislature finds that while the state has one of the most progressive tax structures in the nation, for too many of its residents the future is receding. According to the report, the state's two trillion dollar economy has shifted from being mainly agricultural and manufacturing in the 1950s and 1960s to one based on information and services, which now accounts for 80 percent of all economic activities in the state. To achieve a future as promising as California's past, we need a tax system that is based on this real economy of the 21st century while ensuring that new revenue is invested in strengthening the ladder of mobility for all our residents. The lack of investment in infrastructure and education has diminished opportunities for Californians and continues to fuel the growing income inequality in California. Since 1970, the poorest 20 percent of Californians have seen their household income grow by just 3.1 percent while the income of the richest 20 percent has climbed 74.6 percent.The Upward Mobility Act would help ensure California's residents and businesses can thrive in the 21st century global economy by increasing funding by $10 billion dollars for the following programs.<n> Investing in its residents through education is the foundation on which California has always built its economy. The measure would provide new funds to help rebuild California's education system at every level. The bill would also establish a refundable earned income tax credit to help low-income families offset the burden of the proposed sales and use tax on services. It would also enhance the state's business climate, create jobs, and incentivize entrepreneurship by evaluating the current corporate income tax and linking changes to a more reasonable minimum wage.The Upward Mobility Act seeks to make three broad changes to the state's tax code, including imposing a sales tax on services to increase revenues. The measure's goal is to reduce the income tax rates imposed under the Personal Income Tax for low-and middle-class-income households so that families earning $100,000 pay only $1,000. The obligation of top earners with regard to other tax obligations for top earners, including Proposition 63, would remain intact. The bill's revenue reduction provisions would be phased in only when it is clear that new revenues are sufficient to replace any revisions to the personal income tax and corporate tax. As the revenues secured by Proposition 30 expire, California policy decisionmakers must determine new long term ways to provide for state residents.",

The changes, which took effect on January 1, 2015, require certain public companies to disclose certain financial information to the SEC. The SEC's new reporting requirements apply to public companies that are not publicly traded. For example, if a public company is publicly traded, it is required to disclose the name, address, and general description of the business activity of that publicly traded company. In addition, public companies must disclose the amount and date on which a gift is received and the travel destination for purposes of a gift that is a travel payment, advance, or reimbursement. In the case of a loan, the annual interest rate, the security, if any, given for the loan, and the term of the loan are also required to be disclosed. The amended reporting requirements are as follows: (1) The name of every person from whom the business entity received payments if the filer's pro rata share of gross receipts from that person was equal to or greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during a calendar year. (2) The name and address of each source of income aggregating one thousand dollars or more in value, or fifty dollars ($50) or more, if the income was a gift.

For purposes of this section, a gift of travel does not include any of the following: (1) Travel that is paid for from campaign funds, as permitted by Section 4 (commencing with Section 89510), or that is a contribution. (2) The travel is provided by a government agency, a foreign government, a bona fide public or private educational institution, as defined in Section 203 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, a nonprofit organization that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or by a person domiciled outside the United States who substantially satisfies the requirements for tax-exempt status. (3) The travel that is reasonably necessary in connection with bona fide business, trade, or profession and that is excluded from the criteria for federal income tax deduction for business expenses in Sections 162 and 274 of the IRS Code, unless the sole or predominant activity of the business is making speeches. (4) The guidance does not apply to payments for travel that are not reported on the recipient's statement of economic interests.The gift shall be subject to the limitations on gifts specified in Section 89503.<n>No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction.

The Act's purpose is to increase the number of primary care providers serving California's underserved populations. As of 2010, California needed an estimated 8,243 primary care physicians by 2030, which is about 412 new primary care physician per year. In California, only 368 slots are available each year to medical students seeking to train in family medicine. Without the funding, 158 of those slots will be lost, creating a terrible deficit of physicians in California's underserved communities.

The bill would also prohibit the department from conditioning an applicant's or recipient's eligibility for aid on the applicant's or recipient's disclosure of information regarding rape, incest, or contraception, as specified, or the applicant's or recipient's use of contraception.\nExisting law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county aid grant costs under the CalWORKs program.\nThis bill would declare that no appropriation would be made for purposes of the bill.\nTo the extent that this bill affects eligibility under the CalWORKs program, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.",

      "text": "On January 1, 2013, the California legislature amended Section 7522 of the State of California Government Code to require public employees to participate in a defined benefit pension plan offered by a public employer. The amended law applies to all state and local public retirement systems and to their participating employers, including the Public Employees' Retirement System, the State Teachers' Retirement system, the Legislators' RetirementSystem, the Judges' Retirement System II, county and district retirement systems created pursuant to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et seq.) of the Education Code, and to individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The law does not apply to public employees whose interests are protected under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code until a federal district court rules that the application of this article precludes certification under that section, or until January 1, 2016, whichever is sooner. An individual who was employed by any public employer before January 1, 2013 and became subject to a different defined benefit plan in a different public retirement system offered by his or her employer shall be subject to that plan as it would have been available to employees who were first employed by the subsequent employer on or before December 31, 2012, if the individual was subject to concurrent membership for which creditable service was performed in the previous six months or reciprocity established under any of the following provisions: (a) The law will not apply if the public employer began participation in that plan prior to January 1, 2013. (b) The benefit plan required by this article must be determined and certified by the retirement system's chief actuary and the retirement board to have no greater risk and no greater cost to the employer than the defined benefit formula required by the law. (c) The plan must conform to the requirements of this law or must be approved by the Legislature. (d)New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a defined contribution plan that conforms to the requirements of this article or is approved by the Legislature as provided in this subdivision.<n>If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan that consists solely of a defined contributions plan, that employer may continue to offer that plan instead of the pension plan required by this article. However, if the employer adopts a new defined benefit pension plan on or after January 1, 2013 that plan or formula must be determined and certified by the retirement system's chief actuary and the system's board to have no greater risk and no greater cost to the employer than the defined benefits formula required by the law. The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary because of the need to clarify the benefit eligibility rules under the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013 and maintain the integrity of that act and further its purpose.",
      "summary": "The California Public Employees Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas that may not be exceeded by a public employer offering a defined benefit pension plan for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013. Existing law, the Joint Exercise of Powers Act, generally authorizes 2 or more public agencies, by agreement, to jointly exercise any common power, which may include hiring employees and establishing retirement systems. PEPRA authorizes a joint powers authority formed by the Cities of Brea and Fullerton on or after January 1, 2013, to provide its employees the defined benefit plan or formula that those employees received from their respective employers prior to the exercise of a common power, to which the employee is associated, by the joint powers authority to any employee of specified cities who is not a new member and subsequently is employed by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the city providing for the exercise of a common power, to which the employee was associated, by the joint powers authority.\nThis bill would authorize a joint powers authority formed by the Belmont Fire Protection District, the Estero Municipal Improvement District, and the City of San Mateo on or after January 1, 2013, to provide employees who are not new members under PEPRA with the defined benefit plan or formula that was received by those employees from their respective employers on December 31, 2012, if they are employed by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the agency providing for the exercise of a common power, to which the employee was associated, by the joint powers authority. The bill would prohibit the formation of a joint powers authority on or after January 1, 2013, in a manner that would exempt a new employee or a new member from the requirements of PEPRA.\nThis bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Belmont Fire Protection District, the Estero Municipal Improvement District, and the City of San Mateo.",

      "text": "The California Department of Food and Agriculture today announced new regulations regarding the use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in livestock. The new regulations will take effect on January 1, 2018 and apply to all livestock raised, kept, or used for profit in the state. According to the new regulations, an antimicrobial drug must be used in the professional judgment of a licensed veterinarian when it is necessary to treat a disease or infection or to control the spread of a disease. The regulations do not apply to bees or those species that are usually kept as pets, such as dogs, cats, and pet birds. The department will coordinate with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the development of new guidelines for the proper use of antimicrobial drugs for disease treatment, control, and prevention of livestock infections.A person who violates this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) for each day a violation occurs. In addition to the administrative fine, the violator shall attend an educational program on the judicious use of medically important antimicrobial drugs that has been approved by the secretary.<n>The department shall consult with, and conduct outreach to, livestock producers, licensed veterinarians, and any other relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the monitoring efforts. The department has the authority to request and receive copies of veterinary feed directives from the livestock owner, veterinarian, or distributor to fully implement the provisions of this chapter.",
      "summary": "(1) Existing law regulates the distribution and use of livestock drugs, as defined, by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture. Existing law also requires a person to obtain a license from the secretary to manufacture, sell, distribute, or store commercial feed, including commercial feed containing drugs.\nThis bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, prohibit the administration of medically important antimicrobial drugs, as defined, to livestock unless ordered by a licensed veterinarian through a prescription or veterinary feed directive pursuant to a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as specified, and would prohibit the administration of a medically important antimicrobial drug to livestock solely for purposes of promoting weight gain or improving feed efficiency. The bill would require the Department of Food and Agriculture, in consultation with the Veterinary Medical Board, the State Department of Public Health, universities, and cooperative extensions, to develop antimicrobial stewardship guidelines and best management practices on the proper use of medically important antimicrobial drugs and would require the department to gather information on medically important antimicrobial drug sales and usage, antimicrobial resistant bacteria, and livestock management practice data. The bill would require information provided pursuant to those provisions to be held confidential, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to request and receive copies of veterinary feed directives from certain persons to implement the bill's provisions. The bill would make a first violation of the bill's provisions subject to a civil penalty of up to $250 for each day a violation occurs, and would make second and subsequent violations subject to an administrative fine of $500 for each day a violation occurs, except as specified.\n(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.",
