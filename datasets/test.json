        "Human Rights Information Act  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Human Rights Information Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The people of the United States consider the national \n        and international protection and promotion of human rights and \n        the rule of law the most important values of any democracy. The \n        founding fathers defined human rights prominently in the Bill \n        of Rights, giving those rights a special priority and \n        protection in the Constitution. (2) Federal agencies are in possession of documents \n        pertaining to gross human rights violations abroad which are \n        needed by foreign authorities to document, investigate, and \n        subsequently prosecute instances of continued and systematic \n        gross human rights violations, including those directed against \n        citizens of the United States. (3) The United States will continue to receive requests \n        from foreign authorities for legal assistance regarding human \n        rights violations, including the declassification of documents. In addition to requests by Guatemala and Honduras, a Spanish \n        court magistrate, Baltasar Garzon, recently requested from the \n        United States information on General Augusto Pinochet. Currently, the United States responds to declassification \n        requests by following procedures outlined in Presidential \n        directives and executive orders. The overwhelming interest of \n        the United States in the protection and promotion of human \n        rights nationally and internationally requires a significant \n        strengthening of existing declassification procedures, \n        including section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \n        known as the ``Freedom of Information Act''). (4) The expedient declassification of human rights \n        documents in full compliance with United States security \n        interests according to the procedures outlined in this Act will \n        protect global human rights by strengthening the rule of law \n        internationally, creating a crucial level of accountability of \n        Federal agencies, and will result in significant saving of \n        Government resources. (5) The commitment to the promotion and protection of human \n        rights and democracy around the world has led the United States \n        to undertake tremendous diplomatic, economic, and military \n        efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad, \n        consistent with the national interests and international \n        leadership role of the United States. In addition, countless \n        humanitarian United States nongovernmental organizations and \n        citizens of the United States promote human rights and \n        democracy in foreign countries. These efforts are thwarted if \n        the cycle of impunity for human rights violations is not broken \n        in those countries, and the likelihood of the need for renewed \n        United States engagements in those areas remains. (6) The United States therefore has a significant interest \n        that newly established or reestablished democratic societies \n        take credible steps to fully investigate and prosecute human \n        rights violations. These steps can include the creation of a \n        national or international truth commission or tribunal, the \n        appointment of a human rights officer, or official national \n        investigations led by credible sections of the civil society, \n        including churches and nongovernmental organizations. (7) The United States has long provided international \n        leadership to end impunity for gross human rights violations \n        and to promote the rule of law around the world by establishing \n        and supporting the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal; in \n        addition, the United States has actively participated in, among \n        others, the International War Crimes Tribunals on the former \n        Yugoslavia and Rwanda.",
        "(6) The United States therefore has a significant interest \n        that newly established or reestablished democratic societies \n        take credible steps to fully investigate and prosecute human \n        rights violations.These steps can include the creation of a \n        national or international truth commission or tribunal, the \n        appointment of a human rights officer, or official national \n        investigations led by credible sections of the civil society, \n        including churches and nongovernmental organizations.(7) The United States has long provided international \n        leadership to end impunity for gross human rights violations \n        and to promote the rule of law around the world by establishing \n        and supporting the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal; in \n        addition, the United States has actively participated in, among \n        others, the International War Crimes Tribunals on the former \n        Yugoslavia and Rwanda. (8) The United States has ratified the Convention against \n        Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment, which in article 9 obligates parties to ``afford one \nanother the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal \nproceedings brought in respect of any [acts of, attempts of, or \ncomplicity in acts of torture], including the supply of all evidence at \ntheir disposal necessary for the proceedings.'' In addition, as a \nmember State of the Organization of American States, the United States \nshould seek to follow the December 8, 1998, recommendation of the \nInter-American Commission on Human Rights ``that member States of the \nOrganization of American States adopt legislative and such other \nmeasures as may be necessary to effectuate the right of free access to \ninformation in files and documents in the power of the State, \nparticularly in cases of investigations to establish criminal \nresponsibility for international crimes and serious violations of human \nrights.'' (9) The Guatemalan peace accords, which the Government of \n        the United States firmly supports, included as an important and \n        vital component an investigation and a report by the Commission \n        for the Historical Clarification of Human Rights Violations and \n        Acts of Violence which have Caused Suffering to the Guatemalan \n        People (referred to in this Act as the ``Clarification \n        Commission''). Despite the conclusion of this investigation, \n        many questions, including the identity of perpetrators of human \n        rights violations as well as the location of bodies of the \n        ``disappeared'', remain unanswered. The Clarification \n        Commission explicitly recommended that ``all available legal \n        and material resources should be utilized [by the Guatemalan \n        Government] to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and, \n        in the case of death, to deliver the remains to the \n        relatives.'' (10) Two days after presenting a parallel investigation, \n        ``Guatemala: Never Again'', by the Historical Memory Recovery \n        Project by the Archbishop of Guatemala, the director of the \n        project, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was assassinated. (11) President Clinton stated in Guatemala on March 10, \n        1999, that ``[f]or the United States, it is important that I \n        state clearly that support for military forces or intelligence \n        units which engaged in violent and widespread repression of the \n        kind described in the report [by the Clarification Commission] \n        was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that mistake. We must, and we will, instead, continue to support the peace \n        and reconciliation process in Guatemala.'' (12) The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human \n        Rights in the Republic of Honduras has been requesting \n        documentation of the United States on human rights violations \n        in Honduras since November 15, 1993.",
